<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">OOLOGISTS VS. &ldquo;RAGE&rdquo; COLLECTORS.</span></h2>
<p class="center smaller">BY W. HULL.</p>
<p>By a &ldquo;Rage&rdquo; Collector is meant
one who is suddenly seized with the
idea that he is deeply interested in
oology, and must get together a collection
of eggs as soon as possible.
Some are inspired by reading oological
papers, others become interested
by associating with those who are at
the height of excitement.</p>
<p>A great many persons are seized
with a greater or less desire to collect
stamps, coins, etc. These can be
identified at any time, but eggs cannot.</p>
<p>A true oologist collects with a scientific
purpose, actuated by a true
love of nature, and an egg is of no
value to him unless its identity is certain.
Some collectors have a large
collection, but know little or nothing
about the parent birds. This would
not be the case if they really cared
for the eggs, but they simply keep
them to gaze upon in blank admiration
and boast that they have so
many more eggs than some one else
who may or may not collect with
real interest.</p>
<p>I have on my tongue&rsquo;s end the
names of at least two dozen collectors
of this class, those that collect
merely for the number of eggs. These
collectors can truly be called &ldquo;Great
American Egg Hogs.&rdquo; Unrefined as
this expression is, nevertheless it is to
the point.</p>
<p>This class of collectors number
many hundred throughout the United
States and Canada. The excuse is
&ldquo;that egg collecting is a healthful
and innocent pastime.&rdquo; Healthful it
is, if one collects the eggs himself
(which is not the case with the majority)
but as to the innocence, that
is due to the fact that it is not taken
under a full view, and as long as it is
healthful and no serious results are
immediately visible, it is taken for
granted to be innocent. This is a
matter which the American Ornithologist&rsquo;s
Union is acting upon, and appeals
to the true oologists, for their
assistance in discouraging these &ldquo;naturalists&rdquo;(?)
in their wild career.&mdash;<i>Milwaukee

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">BIRD DESTRUCTION.</span></h2>
<p class="center smaller">BY JOS. M. WADE.</p>
<p>Twenty to thirty years ago, it was
not an unusual sight to see even the
scarlet tanager, a bright red bird with
black wings and tail, flitting from
tree to tree in the heart of our cities
like a fiery meteor in the sun-light,
and to find their nests, built very
lightly of straws and similar material
on the horizontal limbs of our shade
trees. But they were killed or driven
off long before the advent of bird
millinery as a fashion. They were,
indeed, a &ldquo;shining mark,&rdquo; and every
body wanted a specimen, or thought
they did, until at the present time
the scarlet tanager is really a very
rare bird throughout the New England
States.</p>
<p>The Baltimore oriole, so named because
the colors of the bird, black
and yellow, resembled those of Lord
Baltimore, has almost met the same
fate, as it has done duty in ornamenting
thousands of ladies&rsquo; bonnets within
the past five years. Four years ago
this bird was quite plenty on the
elms of Boston and suburbs. The
hanging nests, made of hemp, old
twine, etc., were quite common. But
the past season showed a great
change. These birds have been shot
so ruthlessly, both while here and at
the South, and during the migration,
that hardly a pair could be found
during the breeding season of 1886.</p>

<p class="center smaller">BY WM. L. KELLS, LISTOWEL, ONTARIO.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">TRAILL&rsquo;S FLYCATCHER.</span>
<br />(<i>Empidonax pusillus Trailli.</i>)</h3>
<p>In size and general appearance,
this species closely resembles the
wood pewee; but its habitat and
mode of nesting are much different. It
does not frequent the back-woods
nor the high timbered places; and
not until a thick second-growth of
low underwood succeeds the original
forest in low swampy places does it
make its appearance in the central
districts of Ontario. Then it is so shy
and wary, darting off into the deepest
concealment whenever its haunts
are invaded by the presence of human
kind, that were it not for its
noisy notes, it would scarcely be
known to exist.</p>
<p>It arrives in this vicinity toward
the end of May, when its haunts are
being clothed with the emerald foliage
of summer, and when it can the
more easily conceal itself from observation,
which it appears to dread.
Then, however, the rapidly repeated
&ldquo;wick-we-o&rdquo; of the male, as he
perches on some elevated, but shady
branch, intimate its presence, and
that his mate has probably chosen
the neighboring thicket for her summer
home, while should this be penetrated,
her sharp &ldquo;twick,&rdquo; repeated
in a repellant tone, gives the intruder
to understand that she is there, and
that his presence is not welcome.</p>
<p>It is very active in its movements,
and darts through the shrubbery
with the rapidity of a flash. It appears
to subsist chiefly on insects,
many of which it captures on the
wing after the manner of its family.
It is only in recent years that this
species has become a summer resident
of this vicinity; and in the particular
places where it chooses to reside,
it seems yearly to be more
common. In the manner and position
of its nest, it differs from all the
other Canadian flycatchers. This is
placed in deep concealment among
the thick foliage of the particular
shrub, bush or underwood in which
it is built, and if the first efforts at
brood raising are successful, it does
not appear to nest again that season,
but if otherwise, it will try again.
Its first nest may be found the early
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
part of June, but its efforts at reproduction
appear to cease after the
month of July, and it becomes silent
as August advances.</p>
<p>On the 19th of July, 1885, my boys
reported to me they had found the
nest of a new kind of bird in a piece
of low woods on the farm opposite
Wildwood. They stated that the
bird was nearly as large as a hermit
thrush, but more like a flycatcher;
that the nest&mdash;placed in a low blue
beech&mdash;was like an indigo bird&rsquo;s, but
that the three eggs which it contained,
were like those of a vireo. Eager
to ascertain what this new discovery
might be, I returned with the boys
to the nesting place, and though the
owner was absent, I saw at a glance
that it was a discovery new to me.
The nest was placed in the fork of a
small blue beech, three feet off the
ground, well concealed among the
leaves and surrounding raspberry
vines. It was composed externally
of wool and coarse grasses; and lined
with fine dry grass and some horsehair.
The three eggs were of a
whitish-yellow hue, with a few redish
dots toward the large end. Now,
anxious to see the owner of this nest,
I took a ramble through the wood,
where I heard and saw the male bird,
and when I returned the female
flushed off the nest and darted into
the neighboring thicket, and for
some time I supposed this species to
be the olive sided flycatcher, but
learning my mistake, I became certain
that it was the <i>Trailli</i>, and have
since been confirmed in this identification.
The next summer, about the
20th day of June, within a few yards
of the above mentioned place, I
found in the forks of a small swamp
elm, about four feet off the ground,
another nest of the same species;
much the same in composition, and
containing three fresh eggs, similar
in hue and markings. And on the
same day, a few rods further in the
wood, another nest of this species,
containing three young a few days
old. This nest, however, was in the
forks of a red-maple sapling about
nine feet off the ground, and some of
the coarse grass stalks of which it
was composed hung down nearly a
foot from the bottom of the nest.
Last season I failed to discover any
nests of this species, though I found
the birds in several other places.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">THE LEAST FLYCATCHER.</span>
<br />(<i>Empidonax minimus.</i>)</h3>
<p>This species, in general appearance
and place of habitat, much resembles
the wood pewee, but it is
smaller in size, and its mode of nesting
is quite different.</p>
<p>Its scolding notes are the repetition
of a simple &ldquo;chip&rdquo;; but these are seldom
heard except when its nest or
young are approached. Its song, if
such it may be called, resembles the
word &ldquo;chebeck&rdquo; repeated in a clear
tone, may often be heard, especially
for some weeks after its arrival.</p>
<p>Its advent here usually occurs in
the latter part of May; and it leaves
Canada for more southern latitudes
in the early part of September.</p>
<p>Its usual habitat is the high, rolling,
hard-wood timbered lands; and
for the hilly margins of gravel-bottomed
creeks, it seems to have a decided
partiality.</p>
<p>In the dry season it feeds occasionally
on small fish, which it easily captures,
as they wriggle in the shallow
water, though in general it feeds on
small insects and their progeny in
various stages of development.</p>
<p>This little creature is quite pugilistic,
and in the pairing season two
males often indulge in a free and
fierce fight, which probably influences
the female in her decision of
accepting the victor as her future
partner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>The nest of this species is placed in
the upright fork of a small tree, or
where some small branches project
from a larger stem. It is a neat,
compact structure, much like that of
the redstarts, composed chiefly of
the fibrous matter that forms between
the bark and wood of decayed
trees, lined with fine hair. The set
of eggs, numbering from two to five,
are of a clear white hue. It does not
appear to nest more than once during
the season.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><span class="sc">For The Hawkeye O. and O.</span> BIRD NESTING IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.</span></h2>
<p class="center smaller">BY WALTER RAINE, TORONTO, CANADA.</p>
<p>Crossing the stream above Thornton
Force, we ascend a hill; and on
reaching the top a splendid panorama
opens before us. Towards the west,
the river Lune wends its way for
nearly twenty miles, and after passing
through the town of Lancaster,
empties itself into Morcambe Bay.
The sun is shining on the sea, which
is twenty miles away, although it
does not appear half that distance.
The atmosphere is very clear in this
region, and taking out our field glass
we plainly see several ships and
steamers sailing in the Irish Sea.
Towards the north are the mountain
peaks of Cumberland and Westmoreland,
standing out boldly; to the east
stands Ingleborough mountain, towards
the foot of which we make our
way. We soon cross another stream
which runs over Beezley Falls and
down through another fairy gorge
called Crina Bottom, which is similar
to the one we have just traversed,
with numerous cascades, and where
more water ouzels, wagtails and redpolls
breed; but we have not time to
stay here, wishing to get on to the
moors to find some plover&rsquo;s eggs.</p>
<p>Crossing some fields we find a nest
of the skylark with four eggs. The
mate is soaring high in the air and
pouring out his joyous strains; it reminds
us of the old German hymn:
&ldquo;Hark! Hark! the Lark at Heaven&rsquo;s
gate sings.&rdquo; He is truly a wonderful
songster. Immediately on leaving
the ground, he begins to pour out
his song, and soaring upward and
upward, until he is a mere speck in
the sky, when he begins to descend
and does not cease singing until he
reaches the earth again.</p>
<p>The titlark is one of the commonest
birds of this district and we come
across several nests, by the birds
starting from in front of our feet.
Their nests are always on the ground,
made of dried grass, lined with hair:
and contain from four to six eggs of a
dusky brown, mottled over with
darker brown, some having black
hair lines around the egg.</p>
<p>A wheatear flying from out of some
stones attracts our notice; and here
is a nest made of grass and rabbit&rsquo;s
fur, containing six pale blue eggs, not
unlike the American blue-birds.
This wheatear is called stonechat in
America, though it must not be confounded
with the English stonechat
which is a different species.</p>
<p>We now reach the moors and are
soon up to the knees in heather.
Bird life here is very numerous.
Lapwing plovers fly over our heads,
crying &ldquo;pewit, pewit&rdquo; in a plaintive
note; long-billed curlews are screaming
loudly; golden plovers are
whistling; red grouse are crowing;
ring ouzel are calling; and above all
can be heard the welcome cry of the
cuckoo. High in the air, several
snipes are drumming. This noise is
caused by the bird&rsquo;s wings as it rapidly
descends in the air. Nothing is
more delightful than a ramble over a
Yorkshire moor, where the purple
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
heather grows in place of grass, relieved
here and there with stretches
of bracken, gray rocks and boulders.
A lapwing rises some distance in
front, and marking down the spot,
we soon stand gazing upon its nest
and four eggs with their points inward,
meeting in the center, after
the fashion of all plover&rsquo;s eggs. The
nest is simply a slight hollow in the
ground, lined with bits of grass. The
eggs have a dark olive ground, abundantly
blotched with brown and
black; average size 2.00x1.50. These
eggs are much sought after as delicacies
for the table; and are offered for
sale in the markets at three pence
and four pence each. We look
around and soon find several more
nests and eggs; and in less than
twenty minutes we have taken some
two dozen eggs, and as we don&rsquo;t wish
to carry them along with us, we hide
them beneath a rock from carrion
crows until we return.</p>
<p>Jumping over a little brook, a
snipe darts away from a tuft of grass.
In the center are snugly laid four
richly marked eggs of a greenish-olive
hue, blotched and spotted with
two or three shades of brown. A
large series show the eggs to differ
much in ground color and markings.
This bird is numerous in Yorkshire;
I have found it breeding in all parts
of the county.</p>
<p>Only two species of duck nest in the
moors, near the lagoons, the common
mallard and the teal.</p>
<p>The mallard usually lays from seven
to twelve pale olive-green tinted eggs
in a nest of grass, lined with down;
size about 2.25x1.60.</p>
<p>The teal builds a nest of vegetable
substances, lined with down and
feathers. Six to twelve eggs are laid
of a buffy white; size, 1.75x1.25.</p>
<p>The short-eared owl is found nesting
here; its nest is always on the
ground, a simple structure of sticks,
grass and heather, upon which it lays
four or five white elliptical eggs, averaging
in size 1.55x1.25.</p>
<p>Three other species of owls nest in
this district: the barn owl, the tawny
owl and the long-eared owl.</p>
<p>The latter generally selects some
old crow or magpie&rsquo;s nest; and lays
from four to six eggs, not so round as
those of the short-eared species.</p>
<p>Tramping over the moors for a
mile or so, a bird rises from the hillside
before us and dashes away at a
great rate. Marking down the spot,
we find a stone surrounded by bird&rsquo;s
feathers and insects&rsquo; wings, and pick
up a titlark which is still warm. This
is the shambles of a merlin hawk
who was just going to dine off the
titlark when we disturbed him. We
set about to look around for its nest,
when my brother cried out &ldquo;Here it
is with four splendid eggs.&rdquo; In a few
seconds I was there, gazing on the
treasures with delight and admiration.
The nest was a mixed mass of
twigs, heather and brakens, raised a
few inches high; and the four eggs
resting in a slight hollow in the center.
Their ground color was a dark,
crimson brown, speckled all over
with dark brown and black. Some
varieties resemble eggs of the kestril
hawk, but a series of fifty eggs before
me do not show such varieties in
color as the eggs of the kestril do.
As a rule, they are smaller than the
kestril&rsquo;s eggs and not so round, nor
so boldly marked. We blow the eggs
and pack them away with care, and
proceed farther on.</p>

<p class="center smaller">THIRD PAPER, BY L. O., PINDAR, PRES. Y. O. A., HICKMAN, KY.</p>
<p>Following the family <i>Corvid&aelig;</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
comes the family <i>Icterid&aelig;</i>. The commoner
species of this family in this
part of Kentucky are the red-winged
blackbird, the meadow lark, the Baltimore
oriole and the purple grackle.
The orchard oriole and the rusty
blackbird are also found; but over
two years of study and careful searching
in our woods and fields has failed
to detect the bobolink and cowbird.</p>
<p>I purpose to devote this paper to
the meadow lark and the Baltimore
oriole.</p>
<p>First come; first served. The
meadow or field lark is a common
resident here and seems to collect in
colonies. I know of two fields where
I can always find them, while in
other, seemingly just as favored
meadows, I have failed to see them.</p>
<p>Early in the spring, I think, of &rsquo;87,
I shot at one of these birds and came
very near making a clear miss as only
one shot struck him and that cut off
his leg. I picked him up and was
going to kill him when the thought
came across my mind to make a pet
of him. Accordingly, on reaching
home, I put him in a cage and fed
him corn meal, which he ate greedily.
He also relished a few wheat grains
which I let him have. He grew very
tame shortly, and on several occasions
woke me up in the morning by
his clear, rich whistling; but one day
I left a lot of meal by the cage and
he killed himself eating it. I would
have supposed he would have known
when he had enough, but he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Mr. J. B. Richards, Sec&rsquo;y. Y. O. A.,
writes me that he has known a wild
bobolink to kill itself by eating too
much, and he lost a pet bobolink in
the same way.</p>
<p>The meadow lark is accused by
some writers of murdering and devouring,
not only its own, but other
birds&rsquo; nestlings, and of being an egg-sucker;
but I have nothing to offer
on that point myself.</p>
<p>The nest of the meadow lark is
made of grass, etc., built on the
ground, often arched over, and sometimes
at the foot of a bush or weed.</p>
<p>The eggs are four to six in number;
crystal white, more or less marked
with reddish-brown dots; average
size, 1.10x.80.</p>
<p>And now, having called the bird a
&ldquo;lark&rdquo; all through the article, let me
say that it is not a lark at all, but a
starling. The old name is, however,
too firmly established to permit of a
change.</p>
<p>The Baltimore oriole is a summer
resident and quite common. The
males arrive about the middle of
April, and the females about ten
days later. In 1887, the males arrived
on the 13th, the females on the 23d.
On the 30th, I found a nest nearly finished;
and May 7th it contained five
fresh eggs. Unfortunately the boy
who tried to secure them broke the
whole set.</p>
<p>The oriole is one of our most brilliantly
plumaged birds, and on that
account is much persecuted. I have
heard that they stand captivity well,
but as yet I have had no opportunity
to try.</p>
<p>But it is in the nest that the chief
interest in the study of this species
centers. It is a closely woven pouch
of various substances, grass, wool,
thread, string, hair, lace, ribbons,
rags, paper, leaves&mdash;all these and
many more have been found in their
nests. I have one by me now which
is composed entirely of horsehair,
with the exception of a white string
around the rim to bind the hairs together;
and I was shown one in Fulton,
Kentucky, made entirely of long
blades of grass.</p>
<p>I made a careful examination of
the nest mentioned in the first part
of the sketch. The foundation was
made entirely of white wrapping
twine, lined with dried grass; and as
if to render it less conspicuous, it was
covered with green locust leaves&mdash;it
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
was in a locust tree&mdash;and suspended
as it was, among a bunch of leaves, it
was next to impossible to see it. I
discovered it by watching the bird.
One string in the nest was over five
feet long. It was wrapped again and
again around a limb, then to the nest,
woven down one side under the bottom
and up the other side to the rim
where it was securely fastened.</p>
<p>The eggs are white, with blackish
spots and scrawls irregularly distributed
over the surface, especially
toward the larger end. The average
size is 1.00x.65, according to Coues;
.92x.65 according to Davie. I consider
the latter more correct so far as it
applies to eggs taken here.</p>
<p>The bird is known by the various
names of fire-bird, golden robin,
hang nest, etc., besides the one given
above.</p>

<p class="center smaller">Correspondence by Ph. Heinsberger.</p>
<p>Prof. Charles Linden, instructor in
natural history at the Buffalo High

mania on Feb. 3.</p>
<p>Prof. Linden came to America from
Breslau, Germany, twenty-five years
ago as a sailor, and was engaged as a
seaman on the great lakes when his
knowledge of natural history became
known and the charge of the collections
of the Society of Natural Sciences
was given him, after which he
took his position in the High School.</p>
<p>The Society sent him abroad every
summer, visiting in turn Brazil,
where he secured many valuable
birds, South America, Hayti, and the
Southern States. In 1879, while exploring
the coast of Labrador, he was
shipwrecked and put ashore by a
rescuing vessel. It was his custom
to send everything new to him to the
Harvard Museum. He was an authority
on ornithology, and a writer

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">THE LARGEST OF ITS SPECIES</span></h2>
<p class="center smaller">A HINT TO OUR GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>The biggest American eagle in the
United States roosts in the state house in
this city. It is the property of Maj. E. J.
Anderson, the state comptroller, and its
roosting place is on an imitation rock in
the window of his private office. The
bird measures seven feet and eleven inches
from tip to tip of its wings, and it is so
tall that if it were alive and standing on
the ground it could pick off a man&rsquo;s waistcoat
buttons without getting on tiptoe.
The profusion of little fluffy feathers on
the under sides of the wings, the peculiar
markings of the breast, and the depression
in the top of the beak are evidences of the
great age to which the bird had attained
before it was killed. Those skilled in
such matters estimate that it must have
been at least 75 years old. It is a genuine
Washington or American eagle, and probably
its only rival in the country, dead or
alive, is at the Smithsonian institute at
Washington, but the specimen there is
smaller.</p>
<p>The graceful yet powerful pose of this
bird and the magnificent sweep of its
wings show clearly how great a libel upon
the bird of freedom is the atrocious figure
that attempts to soar over the bundle of
sticks on the back of the buzzard dollars
of the present day. If the government
will send an artist to Trenton it can obtain
a model from which it can make a
dollar that will not bring the blush of
shame to the cheek of every American
who has to spend it.</p>
<p>Maj. Anderson&rsquo;s eagle was shot in
Hunterdon county, in this state. The
bird is one of the most rare in the country,
and it is scarcely ever even seen near the
haunts of civilization. It is supposed that
advanced age had made this bird unable
to successfully pursue and capture the
game of the wilderness, and that therefore
it had ventured into settled regions
for tamer prey. It was found near a
farmer&rsquo;s barn, and the farmer filled it full
of lead from a shotgun and a revolver
without killing it, and finally captured it
alive, having disabled it by wounds in
the wing. It was taken to the village
station, and lived there on exhibition a
day or two before it died. It was then
given to Maj. Anderson, who had it stuffed
and mounted, and guards it now with the
tenderness and pride of a young father.
He has refused for it offers running well
into the hundreds of dollars.&mdash;Trenton

<h3>LaHoyt, Henry Co., Ia., Mch. 10, &rsquo;88.
<br /><span class="sc">Messrs. Webster &amp; Mead.</span></h3>
<p><i>Dear Sirs</i>:&mdash;March number of the
H. O. and O. at hand, and must say
it is a daisy. I am an oologist, and
on January last I found a nest of the
great horned owl, with two fresh
eggs, which is the earliest I ever
knew it to breed here. The nest was
in an old snag, about ten feet from
the ground. The owl could be plainly
seen and I could almost see the
eggs while standing on the ground.
I had frequently noticed her on the
snag, but thought she was roosting
there through the day. At the time
I found the nest, the snow was on an
average of two feet deep. This is
the second nest of this species that I
have ever found.</p>
<p>Red-tailed hawks are plenty here.
I found eight nests in one season;
they nest here in February and June,
raising two broods. They always
use the same nests each year unless
they are disturbed. I once found a
nest in which they had only laid one
egg, so I went away, leaving it until
they had finished the set. I visited
the nest four days afterward, but
that egg was gone and they never
used that nest again. I have never
found a nest yet of the red-tailed
hawk but what it was in a tall tree,
and <i>always leaning</i> over a ravine.
They trouble the farmers&rsquo; fowls a
great deal, often killing the largest
hens. I once set a steel trap by a
hen which they had killed and next
morning I had the male.

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">SUGGESTIONS FOR PROPERLY FORMING COLLECTIONS OF BIRDS&rsquo; EGGS.</span></h2>
<p>If the identification has been effected
only by obtaining a good view of
the birds, the fact should be stated
thus: &ldquo;Bird well seen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bird seen,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Bd. sn.,&rdquo; as the case may be.
For eggs not taken by the collector
himself, but brought in by natives,
or persons not having a knowledge
of ornithology, the <i>local name</i> or the
<i>name applied by the finder</i> should <i>only</i>
be used, unless indeed it requires interpretation,
when the scientific
name may be added, but <i>always within</i>
brackets thus: &ldquo;Toogle-aiah
(<i>Squatarole helvetica</i>);&rdquo; the necessary
particulars relating to the capture
and identification being added. Eggs
found by the collector, and <i>not</i> identified
by him, but the origin of which
he has reason to think he knows,
may be inscribed with the common
English name of the species to which
he refers them; or if it has no appellation,
then the scientific name may
be used, but in that case <i>always with
a note of interrogation</i> (?) after it, <i>or
else</i> the words &ldquo;Not identified.&rdquo; If
the collector prefers it, many of these
particulars may be inscribed symbolically
or in short-hand, but <i>never unless</i>
the system used has previously
been agreed upon with persons at
home, and it be known that they
have a key to it. <i>Each specimen
should bear an inscription</i>; those from
the same nest may be inscribed; but
different nests, especially of the same
or nearly allied species, should never
be so marked that confusion can possibly
arise. It is desirable to mark
temporarily with a <i>pencil</i> each egg
as it is obtained; but the permanent
inscription, which should always be
ink, should be deferred until after
the egg has been emptied. The number
terminating the inscription in all
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
cases referring to the page of the
collector&rsquo;s note-book, wherein full details
may be found, and the words or
letters preceding the number serving
to distinguish between different collectors,
no two of whom ought to
employ the same. (The initial letter
of the collector&rsquo;s name, prefixed to
the number, will often be sufficient.)</p>
<h3>PREPARATION OF SPECIMENS.</h3>
<p>Eggs are emptied, with the least
amount of trouble, at <i>one</i> hole, which
should be drilled in the <i>side</i> with
an instrument called the egg-drill.
The hole should, of course, be
proportioned to the size of the egg
and the amount of incubation it has
undergone. Eggs that are hard sat
upon are more easily blown by being
kept a few days, but the operation
must not be deferred, too long, or
they are apt to burst violently immediately
upon being punctured,
though this may be avoided by holding
them under water while the first
incision is made. The hole being
drilled, the lining membrane should
be cleared away from the orifice with
a small penknife, by which means
not only is the removal of the contents,
but the subsequent cleansing
of the specimen facilitated. The
small end of a blowpipe should then
be introduced, while the other extremity
is applied to the mouth and
blown through, <i>at first very gently</i>.
If the embryo is found to be moderately
developed, a stream of water
should be introduced by means of a
syringe, and the egg then gently
shaken, after which the blowpipe
may again be resorted to, until by
the ultimate use of both instruments,
aided by scissors, hooks, knives and
forceps, the contents are completely
emptied. After this the egg should
be filled with water from the syringe,
shaken, and blown out, which
process is to be repeated until its interior
is completely cleansed, when it
should be laid upon a pad of blotting
paper or fine cloth, with the hole
downwards, its position on the pad
or cloth being occasionally changed,
until it is perfectly dry. During this
time it should be kept as much as
possible from the light, especially
from the sunshine, as the colors are
then more liable to fade than at any
subsequent time. In the case of very
small eggs, when fresh, the contents
may be sucked out by means of a
bulbed tube, and the interior afterwards
rinsed but as before. It is always
advisable, as far as possible, to
avoid wetting the outside of the shell
as the action of water is apt to remove
the &ldquo;bloom,&rdquo; affect the color,
and in some cases alter the crystalization
of the shell. Consequently
dirt stains or dung spots should never
be removed. While emptying the
contents, it is well to hold the egg
over a basin of water, to avoid breakage
in case of its slipping from the
fingers. Eggs that are very hard sat
upon, of whatever size they may be,
should be treated in the manner detailed
in &ldquo;Concluding Observations,&rdquo;
in next issue, which is a method superior
to any other known at present
to the writer for preventing injury
arising to them. Should the yolk of
the egg be dried up, a small portion
of <i>carbonate of soda</i> may be introduced
(but with great care that it
does not touch the outer surface of
the shell, in which case the color is
likely to be affected) and then the
egg filled with water from the syringe,
and left to stand a few hours
with the hole uppermost, after which
the contents are found to be soluble
and are easily removed by the blowpipe,
assisted by one of the hooks.
It is almost unnecessary to add, except
for the benefit of beginners, that
the manipulation of the different instruments
requires extreme caution,
but a few trials will give the collector
the practice necessary for success.
Those who may still prefer to
blow eggs by means of <i>two</i> holes are
<i>particularly requested not to make
them at the ends of the eggs, nor on opposite
sides</i>, but on the same side. In
this case the hole nearest the smaller
end of the egg should be the smallest
and the contents blown out at the
other. If the holes are made at the
<i>ends</i> of the eggs, it not only very
much injures their appearance as
cabinet specimens, but also prevents
their exact dimensions from being ascertained
accurately; and if they are
made at <i>opposite</i> sides, the extent of
the &ldquo;show surface&rdquo; is thereby lessened.</p>

<p>I note what Mr. Foote says in regard
to my &ldquo;Nests and Eggs.&rdquo; When I
sent you the &mdash;&mdash; copies they were all
I had in stock&mdash;at least I thought so,
for it was all I could find in the closet
where I kept them. In turning over
a large number of ornithological
books for reference, I found a package
of eight copies, one of which I
sent Mr. Foote and quoted prices,
but he did not take them and I sent
them to Mr. Lattin who was entirely
out of them and wanted them and
500 more if he could get them at

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><span class="sc">For The Hawkeye O. and O.</span> HOW TO COLLECT AND PREPARE CONCHOLOGICAL SPECIMENS.</span></h2>
<p class="center">BY J. A. SINGLEY.</p>
<p>The editors having given me permission
to ride my &ldquo;hobby,&rdquo; I intend
to give brief but full instructions on
the above as well as make a few remarks
on matters connected with a
collection. There are many collectors
who can profit by what I write,
but these notes are intended mainly
for the class to which I belonged
about 23 years ago, <i>i. e.</i>: the young
collector and the beginner. Had I
had these instructions then it would
have saved me many a false step
aside from doing some things that,
while not very serious mistakes,
might be called &ldquo;verdant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I want, in the first place, to point
out the advantages of collecting
shells. Collecting can be done all the
year round in many localities; and on
the sea-shore there is no intermission.
There is no climbing of trees as in
egg collecting, and no danger of
broken bones. Shells are not easily
broken, are much handsomer than
eggs; and, best of all, a shell always
carries its name about with it, while
you must take your correspondent&rsquo;s
word for the egg. And tho&rsquo; some
oologists profess to be able to identify
a species by the egg alone, I am
bound to say that after several years
of professional collecting in oology,
that in the majority of cases a species
can <i>not</i> be determined from the eggs.</p>
<p>The first thing a collector thinks of
when a species of any kind is obtained
is the identifying or determination.
The Smithsonian Institution
at Washington, D. C., or the Academy
of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia,
Pa., will always determine
specimens sent them for that purpose.
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
In sending out specimens for naming
be generous. Send all that you can
spare&mdash;and perfect specimens too, as
it is impossible to make a positive
determination from weathered, worn
or broken specimens. Don&rsquo;t ask that
the specimens be returned to you,
but present them to the institutions
or individuals to whom you sent
them for naming. Besides the institutions
named above there are many
of our prominent naturalists who
make a specialty of conchology and
will name any specimens sent to
them for determination. One thing
I wish to warn the beginner against
is submitting his collections to an
amateur and depending on his labeling.
This was one of the &ldquo;verdant&rdquo;
things of which I was guilty.</p>
<p>The beginner in land and freshwater
shells will probably vote such
a pursuit as &ldquo;slow&rdquo; when he first
commences. After making a few exchanges
and seeing the diversity of
form, color, and sculpturing, he will
become interested and begin making
comparisons. He is then on the right
road to knowledge, and as he adds
species after species to his collection
from land, river, or lake and sea, the
hobby will grow on him and it will
not be dropped when entering a business
life as is the case with postage
stamps and eggs, but the collection
will be kept up and give many an
hour&rsquo;s recreation when worried with
the cares of life.</p>
<p>Another advantage of such a collection
is that you don&rsquo;t offend those
&aelig;sthetic people who are horrified at
the idea of collecting birds and eggs
and give us &ldquo;fits&rdquo; for &ldquo;murdering&rdquo; and
&ldquo;robbing&rdquo; the poor birds. To tell the
truth, after years of collecting and
becoming &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; to it a guilty
feeling sometimes comes over me
when taking a set of eggs.</p>

<h2><span class="small"><span class="large">MINERALOGY.</span></span></h2>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><span class="sc">For The Hawkeye O. and O.</span> THE SCIENTIST.</span></h2>
<p class="center">BY H. F. HEGNER, DECORAH, IOWA.</p>
<p>But now he stands upon the sandy
beach with the breakers in sight, his
eyes attracted to the sea weeds and
pearly shells at his feet. He is interested,
and examines them carefully.
Some of the shells he finds inhabited,
and, as he is a naturalist, is soon acquainted
with each specific form,
and has a learned name for it. But
he also finds a real architect in the
delicate tinted coral branches at his
feet. Around the head and mouth of
this little creature, serving as arms
for obtaining food, he finds a number
of tentacles. &ldquo;Nature has given
you a goodly work to do, little architect,&rdquo;
cries the naturalist, &ldquo;and these
tentacles are well adapted to your
animal wants. <i>Polypus</i> is many
armed, and henceforth, most scientifically,
your name shall be polyp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he begins a pleasing
study. Zoophytes he finds everywhere,
spreading their beautiful architectural
works along the continental
borders.</p>
<p>He crosses the stormy Atlantic,
weighing the mighty power that
drives the storm. On, on through
the quiet Indian ocean, the phosphorescent
Indian ocean, naming and
collecting myriad living forms, until
he reaches the beautiful Polynesia,
where, spread out in the tropical sun
are the coral reefs&mdash;monuments of
submerged islands&mdash;with an epitaph
to the departed written in living
characters around each placid lagoon.</p>
<p>The scientist, though, can read and
understand; it is not beyond his conception;
and bringing together these
epitaphs, he forms a perfect image of
those submerged lands. Vegetation
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
and animalization, well defined, are
as clear in his imagination as though,
even now, the white sunlight were
reflected from those ancient islands,
forming a perfect image on the retina.</p>
<p>He studies hard, and his conclusions,
builded on the material laws of
nature, are reliable; and now he returns
to civilization honored and respected,
bringing the material of his
researches to the civilized world.</p>
<p>There are other phenomena tho&rsquo;,
fully as grand as coral islands and
polyps, and he is soon in the field of
work again. The gallant ship carries
him through the wintry northern
seas, with their ice mountains towering
beneath an enfeebled sun, to
the realms of perpetual snow. Past
Greenland&rsquo;s milky glaciers that feed
the Arctic main with ice mountains.
Past the struggling crater of Mount
Hecla, where, bound by the king of
these ultimate realms, the Fire Demon
struggles to be free, groaning
out the essence of wrath from his fiery
nostril in moulten rivers that are
petrified by the rigid Ice King, and
added to the adamantine chains with
which he is bound; on, on to the
north through a world of icebergs
that moan and groan as though they
were fettered in this desolate waste
of frozen sea, to bar the explorer
from the frosty Ice King&rsquo;s ultimate
throne, the North Pole. But no; the
scientific mind knows no defeat, and
he toils on over the icy fields, while
the sun, aweary with his long vigil,
sinks further and further in the horizon,
as though he could no longer
banish the sleep from his eyes, when
lo!&mdash;an open Polar sea stretches
away to the northward, breaking
against a rocky, mountainous coast.</p>
<p>Filled with the joy of first discovery,
the scientist voices the language
of his soul in one grand apostrophe:
&ldquo;Oh restless Polar sea, that breaks
upon this rock-bound coast, and
spreads away, I know not where,
e&rsquo;en as Eternity, had I but my gallant
ship, I&rsquo;d sail thy tossing main!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly he toils back to the south,
and none to soon. Creaking and
roaring the massive icebergs among,
on comes the tempest, and the scientist
is thankful for the much needed
shelter. The sun, too, has deserted
him, and the grand aurora borealis,
like a flaming sword above the
lost Eden, seems to guard the Arctic
realms, while sparkling gems glitter
on each icy pinnacle.</p>
<p>The Arctic winter, which but for
the aurora borealis would be black
as the inkiest night, passes slowly
away. Oh, how cold and gloomy it
is! How the explorer struggles and
struggles with the rigid Ice King,
eagerly waiting for the departed sun
to return and rescue him, and at last
his anxious watch is rewarded. The
east puts on the blush of modesty, a
sure prophesy of his majesty&rsquo;s return,
and immediately his welcome face
appears. As he comes up the way,
the icebergs part to let him pass, and
the gallant ship, freed from her rigid
chains, sails onward to the south.</p>
<p>Thus, even thus it is that the scientist
toils on and on in a masterly
search for truth. Is it for glory or
wealth that he dares this? No; the
luxuries of civilization are even like
contagion in his estimation, and with
a Stoical spirit that is grand, he leads
a purely intellectual life, drawing
from Nature her richest treasures
which she is only too glad to give.
His wisdom is like a rich soil in which
the seeds of knowledge and virtue
germinate. He is a lover of truth,
and in Nature he finds his ideal.</p>
<p>Natural phenomena become beautified
before his studious mind, and
the lower animal forms teach him objective
lessons of wisdom, that, by
their very simplicity, are deeply impressed
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
on his memory.</p>
<p>Even in the profound laws of chemistry
and astronomy he finds a beauty
that is irresistable and studies
them until he develops a giant intellect.
He can see beauty in truth; he
can see truth in Nature; and Nature
becomes his inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><span class="sc">For The Hawkeye O. and O.</span> CARE OF MINERALS.</span></h2>
<p class="center">BY W. S. BEEKMAN.</p>
<p>There seems to be difficulty in realizing
a progress that is not in some
manner dependant upon care. Care
is exemplified at our several points of
observation in the universe, and is
realized in all things capable of advancement.
Ourselves require care.
Care for health, system, surroundings,
character, and appearance.
Among some of the many things,
where, in its advancement, care greatly
tends to produce a degree of perfection,
equal to the amount bestowed,
may be mentioned the various
forms of accumulating objects for advancement.
Among these forms, it
will serve us at present to consider
only that which has for its object-matter
the accumulation of the natural
chemical bodies for mineralogical
study. Every one admires a prettily
arranged series of rocks, and in our
efforts to please both visual and intellectual
senses, ever bear in mind
that the direct results to be obtained
are ever dependent upon the genuineness
of the care bestowed.</p>
<p>Minerals are as much under the necessity
of receiving care as is the delicate
skin of an infant. Those hard
and popularly considered imperishable
bodies we do not exempt from
the rulings of <i>care</i> as one would suppose.
It is the first impulse that
much govern our actions while working
our specimens of the bed-rock.
Specimens must be broken from
their homes as carefully as one would
exhume a mummy. Hammer and
chisel must be deftly applied to the
mother-rock, giving a nip here and
a whack there, making every blow
tell. After securing the specimen
carefully protect all its friable or delicate
parts. This can be done in
many ways; often in emergencies
where one does not care to utilize
their handkerchiefs, a handful of
grass applied to a projecting crystal
will insure its safety while trimming
for cabinet use.</p>
<p>Before trimming your specimen
very much, consider carefully all the
objectionable parts you wish to remove.
As in a game of chess&mdash;you
must know the positions and the effects
of every move. Many times one
will in a hurry glance over a rock
and say: &ldquo;Well, now, if that was
trimmed about so it would be a good
thing.&rdquo; Whack goes the hammer,
and crumble goes the specimen.
Failing to see that there was a weak
place of partial fracture of the rock,
which, had it been seen, could have
been protected, the specimen is destroyed,
owing to the lack of care. In
trimming a specimen consider what
you want saved and what will be better
off than on. See how it can be
best shaped so as to stand easily
and show what is to be admired mostly.
In many instances applying the
chisel to the surface in directing
cleaveage planes will facilitate the
improvement of the mineral at a less
expense of battered material. A hard
compact rock may be more easily
broken by striking the stone while
held in the hand, first protecting the
hand by an old glove, than when laid
on a hard surface. Where a stone is
known to be quickly broken into
fragments it may be found well to
wrap the stone in stout paper, or
cloth, before pounding. In this way
the smaller fragments are easily obtained.
Always trimming your specimens
at the quarry your next attention
should be the wrapping of each
individual in soft paper, previous to
being carried home.</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
